I am a Web Developer at Spider, the Research and Development club of NIT Trichy. In addition to web development, I have a keen interest in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing! Check out my repositories to see my latest work.

I love to write, so head over to check my articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@spamjaneya)
